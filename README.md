# Ball-on-inclined-plane
**Project description**: A ball is balanced on an inclined plane through PID control with a servo motor as an actuator. The control algorithm is developed in an Integrated Development Environment (Atmel Studio 7) and executed on the Atmega128 micro-controller, running on FreeRTOS, to control the position of the ball.

> Equipment: photo electric sensors, servo-motor, Atmega128 micro-controller, actuator lever, plane with side walls and hollow plastic ball.

> Controller: PID

> Control variable: PWM signal (input power to the servo motor)
